# RandomWalk

This program is to find out how the random move strategy works in the graph.

The default graph is PDMAP graph which is also included in the project.

There are two method of initializing the agent instances.

1. Place the agent onto the dominating node
2. place the agent randomly onto the graph

The performance is compared by the number of iterations of the process
